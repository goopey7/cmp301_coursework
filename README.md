# Youtube Video with Features and Timestamps in Description
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_RN4cAX-sU. Even cutting parts out and slightly speeding it up I couldn’t get it under 6 minutes, but timestamps should help check boxes quickly.

# Code/Software Design Features
I made a ShadowMapArray class which can handle multiple depth maps and spit out a single shader resource view to pass into HLSL as a Texture2DArray.

I also made a LightManager class which makes it super easy to add lights in the App class. It’s as simple as calling addPointLIght or addDirectionLight, and the depth maps etc. are all handled for you. Only catch is that this has to be done at initialization, not runtime.
